# CSCI39548-project

Your project should aim to solve a real life problem or provide some significant value. That doesn't always imply it needs to be a project focused on business; it may be a game. It simply means that you must develop a web application or service that solves a problem that exists in the world. For inspiration, take a look around your environment, school, etc and consider any problems that can be solved or any processes that can be re-engineered utilizing knowledge from this course.

You will take part in a group project to create a working responsive website (maximum 4 students per group). Your individual participation in this project will be measured by the number and quality of the code you write as measured by the version control system. If the issue tracker and version control system do not make it apparent what you provided, it will be presumed that you did not participate in the activity. Each group will also be assessed at the end of the semester through a project
presentation. A github repository should be created for the project and named as the project. The instructor should be sent an invite to view the project repository.

A webpage that displays our restaurant, our menu and prices. It allows users to search for things, log in/sign up,-make orders which will be stored in a database associated with the account. And it will also display different recipes and allow users to end their own recipes.
